## 📖 Overview

HUATUO uses eBPF technology to observe anomalous events in real time across core Linux kernel subsystems, including CPU scheduling, memory management, the network protocol stack, and hardware error reporting. When the kernel encounters anomalies such as softlockup, OOM, or hardware MCE errors, eBPF programs hook into kernel functions (kprobes) or kernel tracepoints, capturing process information, kernel call stacks, and network context at the moment the event occurs. The data is passed to user-space handlers via the perf event ring buffer and persisted to Elasticsearch or local disk files.

Compared to traditional kernel log (dmesg/syslog) collection, eBPF-based event observation reduces the risk of data loss from log buffer overflow; it can capture transient anomalies that never appear in kernel logs (such as excessive scheduler tick intervals); and it provides container-level event correlation for precise root-cause analysis in cloud-native environments.

Twelve event types are continuously observed, covering CPU scheduling health (sched_tick, softlockup, hungtask), memory pressure (oom, memory_reclaim_events), the network protocol stack (dropwatch, tcp_retransmit, net_rx_latency, netdev_events, netdev_bonding_lacp, netdev_txqueue_timeout), and hardware reliability (ras).

## 🎯 Use Cases

**Kubernetes Container Memory Fault Diagnosis**: In scenarios where containers frequently restart due to OOM, the oom event records both the process killed by the OOM Killer (victim) and the process that triggered the OOM (trigger), including their memcg cgroup pointers and container IDs. Combined with time-series data, this enables fast root-cause analysis of containers involved in memory contention, reducing the time spent manually reviewing container logs.

**AI Training Cluster Hardware Fault Detection**: On GPU training servers, the ras event continuously collects MCE (Machine Check Exception), EDAC memory controller errors, and PCIe AER (Advanced Error Reporting) errors, classifying them by severity (Corrected / UncorrectedRecoverable / UncorrectedFatal). This enables early detection of hardware aging or single-point failures before training jobs are interrupted, reducing training task losses caused by hardware faults.

**Network Performance Jitter Analysis**: dropwatch observes packet drops in the kernel network stack, tcp_retransmit observes TCP retransmission activity, and net_rx_latency detects end-to-end receive-path latency for individual packets from the network card driver to user space. Separate thresholds are configured per stage (driver to kernel: 5ms, kernel to TCP: 10ms, TCP to user space: 115ms), precisely identifying which network layer causes business timeouts.

**Host Scheduling Health Observation**: The sched_tick (scheduler tick interval, default threshold 10ms), softlockup (CPU unable to schedule, ~1 second), and hungtask (D-state process hang) events jointly cover anomalies along the CPU scheduling path. When system stalls or response timeouts occur, kernel call stacks and other diagnostic data are automatically preserved, supporting offline analysis after the fault clears.

### Fields

All event records include the following common fields:

- **hostname**: Physical machine hostname
- **region**: Availability zone where the physical machine is located
- **uploaded_time**: Data upload time
- **container_id**: Container ID if the event is associated with a container
- **container_hostname**: Container hostname if the event is associated with a container
- **container_host_namespace**: Kubernetes namespace of the container if the event is associated with a container
- **container_type**: Container type, e.g., `normal` for regular containers, `sidecar` for sidecar containers
- **container_qos**: Container QoS level
- **tracer_name**: Event name (e.g., `sched_tick`, `oom`)
- **tracer_id**: Tracing ID for this event
- **tracer_time**: Time when the tracing was triggered
- **tracer_type**: Trigger type — manual or automatic
- **tracer_data**: Event-specific private data (see individual event descriptions below)

### 1. sched_tick

**Description** Measures the interval between scheduler ticks. When the interval reaches the threshold, it records the current kernel call stack and process information. The event can reveal long IRQ-off sections, CPU stalls, or virtualization scheduling delays, but does not by itself prove that softirqs were disabled. `comm` and `pid` identify the task interrupted by the reporting tick; they do not identify the cause of the delay.

**Applicable Scenarios**

- The kernel or a driver disables local interrupts for too long, or hardirq/NMI processing monopolizes the CPU.
- A VM vCPU is descheduled by the host, including high steal time and scheduling stalls.
- Low-level anomalies such as SMI or firmware stalls, delayed clockevent delivery, or lost timer events.

**Usage Boundaries** Normal tick suppression after a successful NO_HZ transition is excluded. Ordinary CPU load or a softirq backlog alone does not imply tick delay. Set the threshold above the target system's normal tick period. The captured stack represents the first tick after the delay and should be correlated with IRQ, steal-time, and hardware metrics.

**Data Storage** Event data is automatically stored in Elasticsearch or as files on the physical machine disk.

### 3. net_rx_latency

**Description** Detects latency events on the protocol stack receive path (NIC driver → kernel protocol stack → user-space receive). Three observation points are set along the receive path; when the latency of any stage exceeds the corresponding threshold (defaults: driver to kernel 5ms, kernel to TCP 10ms, TCP to user space 115ms), the event is recorded with the network 5-tuple, TCP sequence number, latency stage, and latency duration. All TCP states are observed, not limited to ESTABLISHED—receive latency events in SYN, FIN, TIME_WAIT, and other non-ESTABLISHED states are also captured. The host network namespace is excluded by default, observing only container network traffic.

**Data Storage** Automatically stored in Elasticsearch or as files on the physical machine disk.

**Sample Data**

### 5. softlockup

**Description** Detects softlockup events (CPU unable to be scheduled for an extended period, approximately 1 second). Provides information about the target process causing the lockup, the CPU where it occurred, and NMI backtrace information for all CPUs. A backoff strategy is applied: the reporting interval increases from 10 minutes up to a maximum of 3 hours during an event storm to prevent duplicate reports. A softlockup occurrence counter metric is also maintained.

**Data Storage** Automatically stored in Elasticsearch or as files on the physical machine disk.

**Sample Data**

```json
{
    "tracer_data": {
        "cpu": 15,
        "pid": 12345,
        "comm": "kworker/15:0",
        "cpus_stack": "2025-06-10 14:30:22 sysrq: Show backtrace of all active CPUs\nNMI backtrace for cpu 15\n..."
    }
}
```

**Fields**

- **cpu**: CPU number where the softlockup occurred
- **pid**: PID of the process that triggered the softlockup
- **comm**: Name of the process that triggered the softlockup
- **cpus_stack**: NMI backtrace for all CPUs (multi-line text containing timestamps and call stacks)

### 6. hungtask

`hungtask_container_total` attributes events using the blocked task's cgroup identity captured at the raw tracepoint; matched traces carry `ContainerID`. It does not resolve a potentially reused TID later in userspace. Missing container metadata or unsupported identity capture leaves events in the host total only. Container counting is independent of trace-save backoff. CPU and blocked-task stack snapshots remain system-wide. See [HungTask metrics](kernel-wide-insight_en.md#hungtask) for hierarchy matching, fallback and accounting details.

**Description** Detects hungtask events. Captures the kernel stacks of all processes in D state (uninterruptible sleep) and NMI backtrace for all CPUs to preserve the fault scene. A backoff strategy is applied: the reporting interval increases from 10 minutes up to a maximum of 3 hours during an event storm. A hungtask occurrence counter metric is also maintained. Note: some Linux distributions (e.g., Fedora 42) disable hungtask detection by default, in which case this observer will not start.

**Data Storage** Automatically stored in Elasticsearch or as files on the physical machine disk.

**Sample Data**

```json
{
    "tracer_data": {
        "tid": 2567042,

        "blocked_processes_stack": "task:java            state:D stack:    0 pid: 12345 ..."
    }
}
```

**Fields**

- **cpus_stack**: NMI backtrace for all CPUs (multi-line text containing timestamps and call stacks)
- **blocked_processes_stack**: Kernel stack information of D-state processes

### 7. memory_reclaim_events

**Description** Detects direct memory reclaim events for container processes. Triggered when the direct reclaim time of the same process within 1 second exceeds the configured threshold (default 900ms). Records the reclaim duration, process, and container information. **Note: this observer only records events for container processes; host process events are filtered out.**

**Data Storage** Automatically stored in Elasticsearch or as files on the physical machine disk.

**Sample Data**

```json
{
    "tracer_data": {
        "pid": 1896137,

    }
}
```

- **pid**: PID of the triggering process
- **tid**: TID of the triggering thread
- **reclaim_duration_ns**: Direct reclaim duration (nanoseconds)

### 8. ras

**Description** Detects hardware errors from CPU, memory, and PCIe subsystems via kernel tracepoints. Supports five hardware error sources: MCE (Machine Check Exception), EDAC (memory controller), ACPI/GHES (non-standard hardware errors), PCIe AER (Advanced Error Reporting), and MCE threshold interrupts (THR). Errors are classified by severity: `Corrected`, `UncorrectedRecoverable`, `UncorrectedDeferred`, and `UncorrectedFatal`. MCE threshold interrupt events use a cooldown period (default 30 minutes) to suppress interrupt storm-driven duplicate reports.

**Data Storage** Automatically stored in Elasticsearch or as files on the physical machine disk.

**Description** Detects NIC link state change events by subscribing to kernel netlink RTM_NEWLINK messages. Captures events including down/up transitions, MTU changes, AdminDown, and CarrierDown, along with interface name, link status, MAC address, and driver information. At startup, the observer scans the current state of all devices in `device_list` as a baseline; only state changes are reported thereafter.

**Data Storage** Automatically stored in Elasticsearch or as files on the physical machine disk.

**Sample Data**

```json
{
    "tracer_data": {
        "ifname": "eth1",
        "index": 3,
        "linkstatus": "linkStatusAdminDown, linkStatusCarrierDown",
        "mac": "5c:6f:69:34:dc:72",
        "start": false,
        "driver": "ixgbe",
        "driver_version": "5.1.0-k",
        "firmware_version": "3.25 0x80000421 1.2163.0"
    }
}
```

**Fields**

- **ifname**: Network interface name (e.g., `eth1`)
- **index**: Interface index number
- **linkstatus**: Link state change description (may contain multiple states)
- **mac**: NIC MAC address
- **start**: Whether this is a baseline event scanned at startup (`true`: startup scan, `false`: real-time change event)
- **driver**: NIC driver name
- **driver_version**: NIC driver version
- **firmware_version**: NIC firmware version

### 10. netdev_bonding_lacp

**Description** Detects LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol, IEEE 802.3ad) protocol state changes in bonding mode. Reads and records the complete status of all bonding interfaces under `/proc/net/bonding/`, including mode, MII status, Actor/Partner negotiation parameters, and slave link states. **This observer is only activated automatically when an IEEE 802.3ad bonding interface is present on the system.**

**Data Storage** Automatically stored in Elasticsearch or as files on the physical machine disk.

**Sample Data**

```json
{
    "tracer_data": {
        "content": "/proc/net/bonding/bond0\nEthernet Channel Bonding Driver: v4.18.0...\nBonding Mode: IEEE 802.3ad Dynamic link aggregation\nMII Status: down\n..."
    }
}
```

**Fields**

- **content**: Complete bonding interface status information (multi-line text containing LACP negotiation details for all slaves, equivalent to the `/proc/net/bonding/bondX` file content)

### 11. netdev_txqueue_timeout

**Description** Detects NIC transmit queue timeout (TX queue timeout) events. Records the queue index, device name, and driver name where the timeout occurred, used to identify hardware failures on the NIC transmit path.

**Data Storage** Automatically stored in Elasticsearch or as files on the physical machine disk.

**Sample Data**

```json
{
    "tracer_data": {
        "queue_index": 3,
        "device_name": "eth0",
        "driver_name": "ixgbe"
    }
}
```

**Fields**

- **queue_index**: Index of the transmit queue where the timeout occurred
- **device_name**: Network device name
- **driver_name**: NIC driver name

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Architecture

HUATUO's anomalous event observation is built on eBPF technology. Event data is collected in kernel space with minimal performance overhead, and processed by user-space daemons for formatting, filtering, container association, and persistent storage.

    participant K as Linux Kernel
    participant B as eBPF Program
    participant P as Perf Event Buffer
    participant H as Go Event Handler
    participant F as Filter
    participant S as Storage

    K->>B: kprobe / tracepoint fires
    B->>B: Collect event context<br/>(process info / kernel stack / network context)
    B->>P: Write to perf event ring buffer
    H->>P: Read event data (blocking)
    H->>F: Format and apply filters<br/>(threshold / noise / known issues)
    F->>H: Events that passed filtering
    H->>H: Associate container information<br/>(CSS / NetNS mapping)
    H->>S: Persist to storage<br/>(Elasticsearch / local files)
