### 1. Overview

`huatuo-bamai` is the core collector of HUATUO (a BPF-based metrics and anomaly inspector). Its configuration file defines the data collection scope, probe enablement strategy, metric output format, anomaly detection rules, and logging behavior.

The configuration file uses **TOML** format and includes multiple sections such as global blacklist, logging, runtime resource limits, storage configuration, and AutoTracing. Each configuration item comes with detailed comments explaining its purpose, default value, and important notes. This document provides a clear and detailed English explanation for **every configuration item** to help users understand and safely customize the settings.

**Note**: Most parameters are provided as commented defaults (prefixed with `#`). Uncomment and adjust as needed. Changes take effect after restarting `huatuo-bamai`. In production, avoid enabling high-overhead features unnecessarily.

### 2. Global Blacklist

```bash
# Global tracing and metrics configuration.
#
# - BlackList
# Global blacklist for tracing and metrics.
#
BlackList = ["netdev_hw", "metax_gpu", "ascend_npu", "diskio", "tcp_retransmit"]
```

- **BlackList**: Global blacklist for tracing and metrics.

  Modules or hardware to exclude from tracing and metric collection. The default is `["netdev_hw", "metax_gpu", "ascend_npu", "diskio", "tcp_retransmit"]`, which disables tracing and metrics for the network device hardware layer, Metax GPU, Ascend NPU, procfs-based disk I/O statistics, and TCP retransmission tracing. Remove `diskio` to enable disk I/O metrics or `tcp_retransmit` to enable TCP retransmission tracing and its drop-correlation cache. Supports arrays; extend as needed.

### 3. Logging

```bash
# Log Configuration
[Log]
    # - Level
    # The log level for huatuo-bamai: Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Panic.
    # Default: Info
    #
    # - File
    # Store logs to where the logging file is. If it is empty, don't write log
    # to any file.
    # Default: empty
    #
    # Level = "Info"
    # File = ""
```

- **Level**: Log verbosity. Values: Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Panic. Default: Info. Use Info or Warn in production; Debug for troubleshooting.

- **File**: Log file path.

  Specifies the path to the log file. If left empty, logs are not written to any file (output goes to stdout or system logs).

  Default: empty.

  **Description**: In containerized deployments, configure a specific path and integrate with a log collection system for persistence.

### 4. Runtime Resource Limits

Huatuo does not create its own cgroup by default. This section applies only when `--enable-cgroup` is passed; Kubernetes and systemd deployments should use their native resource controls.

```bash
# Runtime limits for the huatuo-bamai process.
[Runtime]
    # - StartupCPULimitCores
    # CPU limit during startup, in cores.
    # Default: 0.5
    #
    # - CPULimitCores
    # CPU limit after startup, in cores.
    # Default: 2.0
    #
    # - MemoryLimitMiB
    # Memory limit in MiB.
    # Default: 2048
    #
    # StartupCPULimitCores = 0.5
    # CPULimitCores = 2.0
    # MemoryLimitMiB = 2048
```

- **StartupCPULimitCores** limits CPU usage during initialization. Default:
  `0.5` cores.
- **CPULimitCores** limits CPU usage after startup. Default: `2.0` cores.
- **MemoryLimitMiB** limits process memory. Default: `2048` MiB.

The configured values remain in their documented units. Memory is converted
to bytes only when the cgroup limit is applied.

### 5. HTTP Server and Tasks

```toml
# HTTP server configuration.
[HTTPServer]
    # - ListenAddress
    # Listen address in "host:port" form.
    # Default: ":19704"
    #
    # - MaxEventStreamClients
    # Maximum number of concurrent clients allowed to hold an open
    # /v1/events/watch SSE connection. Once the limit is reached, new requests
    # are rejected with HTTP 429 until an existing client disconnects.
    # Default: 100
    #
    # - EventStreamKeepAliveIntervalSeconds
    # Interval in seconds at which the server sends an SSE comment ping to each
    # connected client. The ping keeps the connection alive through load
    # balancers and proxies that would otherwise time out idle connections. If
    # writing the ping fails three consecutive times, the server closes the
    # connection.
    # Default: 30
    #
    # ListenAddress = ":19704"
    # MaxEventStreamClients = 100
    # EventStreamKeepAliveIntervalSeconds = 30

# Locally running tracing tasks.
[Tasks]
    # - MaxConcurrent
    # Maximum number of concurrent tasks.
    # Default: 10
    #
    # MaxConcurrent = 10
```

- **ListenAddress** uses `host:port` form. An empty host listens on all
  interfaces.
- **MaxConcurrent** limits locally running tracing tasks.

The event stream settings control `POST /v1/events/watch`. When
`MaxEventStreamClients` is reached, new streams receive HTTP 429.
`EventStreamKeepAliveIntervalSeconds` controls SSE heartbeat comments used to
keep proxy and load-balancer connections alive. After three consecutive write
failures, the server closes the stream. Set the interval below any upstream
idle timeout; 15–60 seconds is typical.

### 6. Storage

#### 6.1 Elasticsearch and OpenSearch Storage

```bash
# Storage configuration
[Storage]
    # Elasticsearch and OpenSearch Storage
    #
    # Disable ES/OS storage if one of Address, Username, Password is empty.
    # Store the tracing and events data of linux kernel to ES/OS.
    #
    # - Address
    # Port 9200 is commonly used for Elasticsearch/OpenSearch HTTP APIs.
    # e.g.
    # http://127.0.0.1:9200
    # https://127.0.0.1:9200
    #
    # - Index
    # Elasticsearch or OpenSearch index, a logical namespace that holds a collection of
    # documents for huatuo-bamai.
    # Default: huatuo_bamai
    #
    # - Username
    # - Password
    # Address, Username, and Password must be either all empty (disabled) or
    # all configured (enabled). Partial connection settings are invalid.
    #
    [Storage.Elasticsearch]
        # Address = "http://127.0.0.1:9200"
        # Index = "huatuo_bamai"
        # Username = "elastic"
        # Password = "REPLACE_WITH_PASSWORD"
```

- **Address**: ElasticSearch/OpenSearch service address.

  No default value.

  **Description**: Used to store kernel tracing and event data. ES/OS storage
  is disabled when Address, Username, and Password are all empty. All three
  values are required when storage is enabled; a partial configuration
  prevents startup.

- **Index**: Index name.

  Default: huatuo_bamai.

  **Description**: Logical namespace for organizing huatuo-bamai tracing and event documents.

- **Username**: Authentication username.

  No default value.

  **Description**: Used for Basic Auth.

- **Password**: Authentication password.

  No default value.

  **Description**: Used together with the username. In production, use a strong password and enable TLS encryption.

**Overall**: ES/OS storage persists kernel tracing and event data for later search and analysis.

#### 6.2 Local File Storage

```bash
# LocalFile Storage
#
# Store data to local directory for troubleshooting on the host machine.
#
# - Path
# The directory for storing data. If the Path is empty, LocalFile will be disabled.
# Default: "huatuo-local"
#
# - RotationSizeMiB
# The maximum size in Megabytes of a record file before it gets rotated
# per kernel tracer.
# Default: 100MB
#
# - MaxRotatedFiles
# The maximum number of old log files to retain for per tracer.
# Default: 10
#
[Storage.LocalFile]
    # Path = "huatuo-local"
    # RotationSizeMiB = 100
    # MaxRotatedFiles = 10
```

- **Path**: Local data storage directory.

  Default: huatuo-local. If empty, local file storage is disabled.

  **Description**: Stores data locally on the host for on-site troubleshooting. Use an absolute path.

- **RotationSizeMiB**: Single file rotation size.

  Maximum size of a record file before rotation (per tracer).

  Default: 100 MB.

  **Description**: Prevents any single file from growing too large and consuming excessive disk space.

- **MaxRotatedFiles**: Maximum number of rotated files to retain.

  Default: 10.

  **Description**: Oldest files are automatically deleted once the limit is reached, controlling disk usage.

### 7. Automatic Tracing

    # performance impact.
    # Default: 1800s
    #
    # - RunTracingToolTimeout
    # Execution timeout of this tracing tool (seconds).
    # Default: 10s
    # 
# NOTE:
# Profiling triggers when:
# 1. UserThreshold AND DeltaUserThreshold are exceeded, or
# 2. SysThreshold AND DeltaSysThreshold are exceeded, or
# 3. UsageThreshold AND DeltaUsageThreshold are exceeded
    #
    [AutoTracing.CPUIdle]
        # UserThreshold = 75
        # SysThreshold = 45
        # UsageThreshold = 90
        # DeltaUserThreshold = 45
        # DeltaSysThreshold = 20
        # DeltaUsageThreshold = 55
        # Interval = 10

  Default: 45%.

- **DeltaSysThreshold**: Short-term system CPU change threshold (%).

  Default: 20%.

- **DeltaUsageThreshold**: Short-term total CPU change threshold (%).

  Default: 10s.

**Trigger Logic**: Tracing runs when any of the following is true:

1. Both UserThreshold and DeltaUserThreshold are met, or
2. Both SysThreshold and DeltaSysThreshold are met, or
3. Both UsageThreshold and DeltaUsageThreshold are met.

**Filter Container Filtering**: Use Included/Excluded rule arrays to control monitoring scope.

```bash
    # Each rule contains Field (filter field) and Pattern (regex).
    # Field: container_host_namespace | container_hostname | container_qos
    #
    # [[AutoTracing.CPUIdle.Filter.Excluded]]
    #     Field = "container_qos"
    #     Pattern = "besteffort"
    # [[AutoTracing.CPUIdle.Filter.Included]]
    #     Field = "container_host_namespace"
    #     Pattern = "^application-"
```

- **Filter**: Container filtering rules. Defined using `[[double-bracket]]` syntax with multiple rules, each containing `Field` (filter field) and `Pattern` (regex). Filtering logic:

  - No rules: monitor all containers
  - `Excluded` only: blacklist, skip matched containers
  - `Included` only: whitelist, only monitor matched containers
  - Both: must match Included AND not match Excluded

  Default: no rules, all containers monitored.

#
# - IssuesList
# Known issue filters for autotracing.
#
[AutoTracing]
    IssuesList = []
```

- **IssuesList**: Known issue filter. Format: `[["name", "regex"], ...]`. When a collected stack trace matches the regex, it is labeled with the issue name. Default `[]`.

  Example: `IssuesList = [["known_issue1", "softlockup"], ["known_issue2", "alloc_pages.*failed"]]`

**Note**: Only supports `dload` tracing of known issues filtering, other events are not supported.

### 8. Event Tracing

This section is responsible for capturing key kernel events and monitoring latency, including softirq, memory reclaim, network receive latency, network device events, and packet drop monitoring. It is the core module for kernel-level anomaly context collection in HUATUO.

#### 8.1 Softirq Disable Tracing

```bash
# linux kernel events capturing configuration
[EventTracing]
	# softirq
	#
	# Trace softirq disabled events in the Linux kernel.
	#
	# - DisabledThreshold
	# When the disable duration of softirq exceeds the threshold, huatuo-bamai
	# will collect kernel context.
	# Default: 10000000 in nanoseconds, 10ms
	#
	[EventTracing.Softirq]
		# DisabledThreshold = 10000000
```

- **DisabledThreshold**: Softirq disable duration threshold (nanoseconds).

  Default: 10,000,000 ns (10ms). When softirq is disabled longer than this threshold, kernel context is collected.

  **Description**: Long softirq disable periods can cause delays in networking, timers, etc. Useful for diagnosing interrupt storms or high-load scenarios.

#### 8.2 Memory Reclaim Blocking Tracing

```bash
# memreclaim
#
# The memory reclaim may block the process, if one process is blocked
# for a long time, reporting the events to userspace.
#
# - BlockedThreshold
# The blocked time when memory reclaiming.
# Default: 900000000ns, 900ms
#
[EventTracing.MemoryReclaim]
	# BlockedThreshold = 900000000
```

- **BlockedThreshold**: Memory reclaim blocking time threshold (nanoseconds).

  Default: 900,000,000 ns (900ms). When a process is blocked by memory reclaim for longer than this time, an event is reported to userspace with context.

  **Description**: Memory reclaim blocking is a common cause of process stalls, especially in memory-constrained cloud-native environments.

#### 8.3 Network Receive Latency Tracing

```bash
# networking rx latency
#
# linux net stack rx latency for every tcp skbs.
#
# - Driver2NetRx
# The latency from driver to net rx, e.g., netif_receive_skb.
# Default: 5ms
#
# - Driver2TCP
# The latency from driver to tcp rx, e.g., tcp_v4_rcv.
# Default: 10ms
#
# - Driver2Userspace
# The latency from driver to userspace copy data, e.g., skb_copy_datagram_iovec.
# Default: 115ms
#
# - ExcludedContainerQos
# Blacklist: skip containers whose qos level matches.
# Values: "guaranteed", "burstable", "besteffort" (case-insensitive).
# Default: [].
#
# - ExcludedHostNetnamespace
# Exclude packets in the host network namespace.
# Default: true
#
[EventTracing.NetRxLatency]
	# Driver2NetRx = 5
	# Driver2TCP = 10
	# Driver2Userspace = 115
	# ExcludedContainerQos = []
	ExcludedContainerQos = ["besteffort"]
	# ExcludedHostNetnamespace = true
```

- **Driver2NetRx**: Latency threshold from driver to network receive layer (e.g., netif_receive_skb).

  Default: 5ms.

- **Driver2TCP**: Latency threshold from driver to TCP receive (e.g., tcp_v4_rcv).

  Default: 10ms.

- **Driver2Userspace**: Latency threshold from driver to userspace data copy (e.g., skb_copy_datagram_iovec).

  Default: 115ms.

- **ExcludedContainerQos**: Container QoS levels to exclude (blacklist).

  Default: []. Corresponds to Kubernetes Pod QoS levels (Guaranteed, Burstable, BestEffort).

- **ExcludedHostNetnamespace**: Whether to exclude packets in the host network namespace.

  Default: true.

#### 8.4 Network Device Event Monitoring

```bash
# netdev events
#
# Monitor network device events.
#
# - DeviceList
# The net devices we monitor.
# Default: [] (empty, meaning no devices).
#
[EventTracing.Netdev]
	DeviceList = ["eth0", "eth1", "bond4", "lo"]
```

- **DeviceList**: List of network device full-match regex patterns to monitor. Literal names such as `"eth0"` keep exact-match behavior; patterns such as `"bond[0-9]+"` can select multiple devices.

  Default example includes "eth0", "eth1", "bond4", "lo". An empty list means no devices are monitored.

  **Description**: Monitors physical link status events for specified network interfaces.

#### 8.5 Packet Drop Monitoring

```toml
[EventTracing.Dropwatch]
    # tcpdump-style filter expression, forwarded to dropwatch --filter.
    # Default: "tcp"
    Filter = "tcp"

    # Forwarded to dropwatch --max-events-per-second.
    # Default: 100; 0 disables rate limiting.
    MaxEventsPerSecond = 100

    # Reserved configuration field. It is not currently consumed by the
    # dropwatch event path and therefore has no filtering effect.
    # Default: []
    ExcludeContainers = []
```

- **Filter**: tcpdump-style packet filter passed to `dropwatch --filter` and applied by the BPF program before events are emitted.

  Default: `"tcp"`.

- **MaxEventsPerSecond**: Maximum number of dropwatch events emitted by BPF per second.

  Default: `100`. Set to `0` to disable rate limiting.

- **ExcludeContainers**: Reserved container-exclusion list.

  Default: `[]`. The field exists in the configuration schema, but the current dropwatch event path does not read or forward it, so configuring it has no effect. Use `EventTracing.IssuesList` for operator-defined dropwatch call-stack suppression.

#### 8.6 TCP Retransmission Tracing ([EventTracing.TCPRetransmit])

```bash
[EventTracing.TCPRetransmit]
    # Forwarded to tcpshark --filter.
    # Applies only to tcp_retransmit_skb events.
    # Default: ""
    Filter = ""

    # Forwarded as tcpshark --enable-tlp. Default: false.
    EnableTLP = false

    # Forwarded as tcpshark --max-events-per-second.
    # Default: 100; 0 disables rate limiting.
    MaxEventsPerSecond = 100
```

- **Filter**: tcpdump-style filter expression passed to `tcpshark --filter`.

  Default: empty string. It applies only to `tcp_retransmit_skb` events.

- **EnableTLP**: Whether to collect `tcp_send_loss_probe` events.

  Default: false.

- **MaxEventsPerSecond**: Maximum TCP retransmission events emitted by BPF per second.

  Default: 100. Set to 0 for unlimited output. When the limit is exceeded, `tcpshark` logs `rate limit hit`.

#### 8.7 Hardware Error Event Tracing (EventTracing.Ras)

```bash
# ras
#
# Hardware error event tracing (RAS: Reliability, Availability, Serviceability).
# Captures MCE, EDAC, ACPI/GHES, PCIe AER, and MCE threshold (THR) events via eBPF.
#
# - MceThrBackoff
# Minimum interval in seconds between consecutive MCE threshold (THR) event saves.
# THR events are fired by the local-APIC threshold interrupt and can storm at high
# frequency; this cooldown prevents flooding storage with redundant records.
# Default: 1800s (30 minutes)
#
[EventTracing.Ras]
    # MceThrBackoff = 1800
```

- **MceThrBackoff**: Minimum cooldown in seconds between MCE threshold (THR) event saves.

  Default: 1800s (30 minutes).

  **Description**: THR events are generated by the CPU's local-APIC threshold interrupt when correctable hardware errors accumulate. These can fire at very high frequency during hardware degradation. The backoff suppresses redundant saves while ensuring at least one record is captured per interval. Lower values provide more granular event records at the cost of higher storage throughput; in environments with frequent correctable errors, consider raising this value to reduce noise.

#### 8.8 Known Issue Filtering (IssuesList)

```bash
# Linux kernel event tracing configuration.
#
# - IssuesList
# Known issue filters for event tracing.
#
[EventTracing]
    IssuesList = []
```

- **IssuesList**: Known-issue suppression rules in the form `[["name", "regex"], ...]`. Default `[]`.

  For `net_rx_latency`, each regex is matched against the generated event title. For `dropwatch`, it is matched against the newline-joined kernel call stack. A match causes the event to be discarded; the configured name identifies the rule but is not added to the saved event.

  Example: `IssuesList = [["ignored_process", "comm=ignored_process"], ["neighbor_cleanup", "neigh_invalidate/"]]`

#### 8.9 OOM Victim Runtime FAST Snapshot

```toml
[EventTracing.OOMRuntimeSnapshot]
Enabled = false
GateTimeoutMilliseconds = 50
CaptureCooldownMilliseconds = 30000
FailureCooldownMilliseconds = 60000
MaxFailureCooldownMilliseconds = 300000
MaxConcurrentGates = 1
MaxOutputBytes = 1048576
MaxObjects = 100000
MaxStacks = 4096
MaxStackDepth = 64

[EventTracing.OOMRuntimeSnapshot.Filter]
Included = []
Excluded = []
```

This feature is disabled by default. It changes only Huatuo and does not need a
patched kernel, kernel module, or device node. Huatuo's OOM BPF program provides
a first-wins, hard-deadline gate in the `oom_kill_process` kprobe. At idle it
does not scan `/proc`, connect to applications, start an
in-process agent, or collect periodically. After the gate identifies a victim,
Go reads the Runtime's existing mbuckets externally. HotSpot uses
`process_vm_readv` to parse VMStructs, G1 regions, object types, and direct
array fields of business objects. CPython 3.8-3.14 externally reads
`_PyRuntime`, pymalloc arenas/pools, and validated GC generation lists from the
target executable/libpython. The 50 ms path does not start a helper or wait for
a remote-debug safe point. It does not require an application module, startup
flag, resident agent, or GDB function call. Java does not require Attach, a JDK
diagnostic command, or a startup flag. The current external Java FAST path
supports Linux x86-64 HotSpot G1 on JDK 8, 11, 17, 21, and 25.
Filters read cmdline only after a
gate request arrives.

`GateTimeoutMilliseconds` defaults to `50`; only values from 1 through 50 ms
are accepted. It is the absolute budget from BPF publication to ACK or
fail-open. It can be changed through the existing dynamic configuration API
without restarting Huatuo. The new value applies to the next OOM gate request;
an in-flight capture keeps the deadline with which it started. For example:

```bash
curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:19704/config \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"config":{"EventTracing.OOMRuntimeSnapshot.GateTimeoutMilliseconds":40}}'
```

The endpoint persists the value and updates the BPF config map. The next OOM
uses the new deadline. If Huatuo hangs or cannot ACK, BPF fails open at the
absolute deadline. An early ACK releases the gate immediately. Ordinary kprobe
BPF cannot sleep, so the first admitted OOM busy-polls and occupies one CPU
during this window. Scheduler and softirq tail latency must be validated on the
production kernel and cpuset before enabling the feature.

`MaxConcurrentGates=1` implements host-wide first-wins admission. While a
capture is active, a new request is counted as `SKIPPED_BUSY`; BPF does not
enter its wait loop and releases it before reading
`/proc`, detecting a language, or starting a provider. After an admitted
request finishes, `CaptureCooldownMilliseconds=30000` suppresses repeated
captures counted as `SKIPPED_COOLDOWN`. The cooldown is live-configurable; zero
disables cooldown but retains busy rejection. Skipped requests only increment
their counters and do not write manifests. Failures back off for 60, 120, and
240 seconds, capped by `MaxFailureCooldownMilliseconds=300000`; success resets
the streak. The BPF gate keeps one active slot and bypasses user-space waiting
for later victims. The normal
`oom_kill_process` event is emitted first, so every bypassed victim still has
the base OOM event and follows the ordinary kill path immediately.

In addition to module-qualified type counts and shallow bytes, Python FAST
aggregates direct fields by owner type, field name, and referenced type. Each
field reports reference count, deduplicated object count, shallow bytes, and
length distribution. This attributes buffers such as
`service.cache.CacheEntry.payload` to a business field without serializing
values. It is not recursive retained-size analysis, and bytes shared across
different fields must not be added together.

The GC-generation fallback covers GC-tracked objects only and reports
layout-estimated shallow bytes. The primary pymalloc path samples by block
size, pool occupancy, and address range, then reports both raw observations
and explicit type estimates. The target must be a little-endian ELF64 image
with the standard `_PyRuntime` dynamic symbol, and Huatuo needs permission for
`process_vm_readv`. The current matrix covers x86-64 CPython 3.8 through 3.14.

FAST results no longer create separate manifest/object JSON files or snapshot
directories. A provider first copies bounded remote evidence into Huatuo, then
ACKs to release the victim. Huatuo sorts and limits that owned data to
`MaxOutputBytes`, then correlates it with the original
`oom_kill_process` event by `victim TGID + oom_timestamp` and embeds it as
`tracer_data.runtime_memory_snapshot` in the same `oom` JSON. The default hard
limit is 1 MiB. Time, object, stack, or byte limits retain the completed Top-N
prefix and report `status`, `truncated`, and `truncation_reasons`. JSON assembly
and localfile/Elasticsearch persistence happen after ACK and do not consume the
50 ms kill-gate budget.

### 9. Metric Collector

This section defines collection rules for various system and network metrics. All `Included`/`Excluded` fields share the same filter logic (regex):

- No rules: all items are collected
- Excluded only: blacklist, matched items are skipped
- Included only: whitelist, only matched items are collected
- Both: must match Included AND not match Excluded

#### 9.1 Netdev Statistics

- **MountPointsIncluded**: Regex for mount points to collect. Default includes /, /home, /boot.

### 10. Pod

This section configures how to fetch Pod information from kubelet to enable container/Pod-level labeling and metric isolation.

```bash
# Pod Configuration
#
# Configure these parameters for fetching pods from kubelet.
#
# - KubeletReadOnlyPort
# The KubeletReadOnlyPort is kubelet read-only port for the Kubelet to serve on with
# no authentication/authorization. The port number must be between 1 and 65535, inclusive.
# Setting this field to 0 disables fetching pods from kubelet read-only service.
# Default: 10255
#
# - KubeletAuthorizedPort
# The port is the HTTPs port of the kubelet. The port number must be between 1 and 65535,
# inclusive. Setting this field to 0 disables fetching pods from kubelet HTTPS port.
# Default: 10250
#
# - KubeletClientCertPath
# https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/best-practices/certificates/
#
# Client certificate and private key file name. One file or two files:
# "/path/to/xxx-kubelet-client.crt,/path/to/xxx-kubelet-client.key",
# "/path/to/kubelet-client-current.pem"
#
# You can disable this kubelet fetching pods, for bare metal service, by
# KubeletReadOnlyPort = 0, and KubeletAuthorizedPort = 0.
#
[Pod]
	KubeletClientCertPath = "/etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-kubelet-client.crt,/etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-kubelet-client.key"
```

- **KubeletReadOnlyPort**: Kubelet read-only port.

  Default: 10255. Set to 0 to disable this method.

- **KubeletAuthorizedPort**: Kubelet HTTPS authorized port.

  Default: 10250. Set to 0 to disable.

- **KubeletClientCertPath**: Path to kubelet client certificate and private key. Supports comma-separated files or single PEM file.

  **Description**: Used for mTLS authentication on the HTTPS port. In non-Kubernetes (bare-metal) environments, set both ports to 0 to disable Pod fetching.

### 11. CLI Flags

`huatuo-bamai` supports the following command-line flags:

```bash
huatuo-bamai --region <region> [options]
```

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--config` | Configuration file name | `huatuo-bamai.conf` |
| `--config-dir` | Configuration file directory | `conf` |
| `--bpf-dir` | BPF object file directory | `bpf` |
| `--tools-bin-dir` | Tracing tool binary directory | `bin` |
| `--region` | Deployment region (required) | - |
| `--disable-kubelet` | Disable kubelet Pod fetching | `false` |
| `--disable-storage` | Disable storage backends | `false` |
| `--enable-cgroup` | Enable self cgroup resource limits (disabled by default) | `false` |
| `--disable-tracing` | Disable specified tracing modules (may be repeated) | - |
| `--log-debug` | Force log level to Debug | `false` |
| `--dry-run` | Load-only test; exit gracefully after startup | `false` |
| `--procfs-prefix` | procfs mount point prefix | - |

### 12. Configuration Override Precedence

When the same configuration item is set in both command-line flags and the configuration file, the following precedence applies:

**CLI flag > Configuration file > Built-in default**

Specific rules:

1. **Log level**: `--log-debug` > config file `[Log] Level` > built-in default `Info`
   - `--log-debug` has the highest priority and forces the log level to `Debug` regardless of the `Level` value in the configuration file.
   - An explicit `Level` in the configuration file overrides the built-in default.
   - If neither is set, the default `Info` is used.

2. **Tracing blacklist**: `--disable-tracing` is merged with the configuration file `BlackList` (they complement each other rather than override).

3. **Other boolean switches** (`--disable-kubelet`, `--disable-storage`): When explicitly set on the command line, they override the configuration file.

### 13. Best Practices and Important Notes

- **Resource Control**: Kubernetes uses Pod resources and systemd uses service limits.
  Use `--enable-cgroup` and `[Runtime]` only for direct execution without an
  external manager.
- **Storage Choice**: For small-scale deployments, prefer [Storage.LocalFile] for local troubleshooting. For large clusters, configure Elasticsearch for centralized storage and querying.
- **AutoTracing Tuning**: Adjust thresholds based on workload characteristics. Thresholds that are too low cause frequent triggering; thresholds that are too high may miss issues. Validate gradually in a test environment.
- **Security**: Use strong passwords for ES configuration and consider enabling HTTPS. Avoid hard-coding sensitive information in the configuration file.
- **Compatibility**: Configuration parameters may be affected by kernel version and hardware environment. Always verify with the official HUATUO documentation for your specific setup.

By properly configuring huatuo-bamai.conf, you can fully leverage HUATUO’s capabilities in kernel-level anomaly detection and intelligent tracing, significantly improving observability and troubleshooting efficiency in cloud-native systems.

If you need deeper customization for a specific scenario, feel free to provide more details about your environment.
