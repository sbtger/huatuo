### 1. Overview

`huatuo-bamai` is the core collector of HUATUO (a BPF-based metrics and anomaly inspector). Its configuration file defines the data collection scope, probe enablement strategy, metric output format, anomaly detection rules, and logging behavior.

The configuration file uses **TOML** format and includes multiple sections such as global blacklist, logging, runtime resource limits, storage configuration, and AutoTracing. Each configuration item comes with detailed comments explaining its purpose, default value, and important notes. This document provides a clear and detailed English explanation for **every configuration item** to help users understand and safely customize the settings.

**Note**: Most parameters are provided as commented defaults (prefixed with `#`). Uncomment and adjust as needed. Changes take effect after restarting `huatuo-bamai`. In production, avoid enabling high-overhead features unnecessarily.

### 2. Global Blacklist

```bash
# Global tracing and metrics configuration.
#
# - BlackList
# Global blacklist for tracing and metrics.
#
BlackList = ["netdev_hw", "netdev_qdisc", "metax_gpu", "ascend_npu", "diskio", "tcp_retransmit", "mthreads_gpu"]
```

- **BlackList**: Global blacklist for tracing and metrics.

  Modules or hardware to exclude from tracing and metric collection. The default is `["netdev_hw", "netdev_qdisc", "metax_gpu", "ascend_npu", "diskio", "tcp_retransmit", "mthreads_gpu"]`, which disables tracing and metrics for the network device hardware layer, qdisc statistics, Metax GPU, Ascend NPU, procfs-based disk I/O statistics, TCP retransmission tracing, and Moore Threads GPU. Remove `diskio` to enable disk I/O metrics, `tcp_retransmit` to enable TCP retransmission tracing, or `mthreads_gpu` to enable Moore Threads GPU metric collection on hosts with MT GPUs. Local correlation does not require the standalone `dropwatch` tracer. Supports arrays; extend as needed.

### 3. Logging

```bash
# Log Configuration
[Log]
    # - Level
    # The log level for huatuo-bamai: Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Panic.
    # Default: Info
    #
    # - File
    # Store logs to where the logging file is. If it is empty, don't write log
    # to any file.
    # Default: empty
    #
    # Level = "Info"
    # File = ""
```

- **Level**: Log verbosity. Values: Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Panic. Default: Info. Use Info or Warn in production; Debug for troubleshooting.

- **File**: Log file path.

  Specifies the path to the log file. If left empty, logs are not written to any file (output goes to stdout or system logs).

  Default: empty.

  **Description**: In containerized deployments, configure a specific path and integrate with a log collection system for persistence.

### 4. Runtime Resource Limits

Huatuo does not create its own cgroup by default. This section applies only when `--enable-cgroup` is passed; Kubernetes and systemd deployments should use their native resource controls.

```bash
# Runtime limits for the huatuo-bamai process.
[Runtime]
    # - StartupCPULimitCores
    # CPU limit during startup, in cores.
    # Default: 0.5
    #
    # - CPULimitCores
    # CPU limit after startup, in cores.
    # Default: 2.0
    #
    # - MemoryLimitMiB
    # Memory limit in MiB.
    # Default: 2048
    #
    # StartupCPULimitCores = 0.5
    # CPULimitCores = 2.0
    # MemoryLimitMiB = 2048
```

- **StartupCPULimitCores** limits CPU usage during initialization. Default:
  `0.5` cores.
- **CPULimitCores** limits CPU usage after startup. Default: `2.0` cores.
- **MemoryLimitMiB** limits process memory. Default: `2048` MiB.

The configured values remain in their documented units. Memory is converted
to bytes only when the cgroup limit is applied.

### 5. HTTP Server and On-demand Operations

```toml
# HTTP server configuration.
[HTTPServer]
    # - ListenAddress
    # Listen address in "host:port" form.
    # Default: ":19704"
    #
    # - MaxEventStreamClients
    # Maximum number of concurrent clients allowed to hold an open
    # /v1/events/watch SSE connection. Once the limit is reached, new requests
    # are rejected with HTTP 429 until an existing client disconnects.
    # Default: 100
    #
    # - EventStreamKeepAliveIntervalSeconds
    # Interval in seconds at which the server sends an SSE comment ping to each
    # connected client. The ping keeps the connection alive through load
    # balancers and proxies that would otherwise time out idle connections. If
    # writing the ping fails three consecutive times, the server closes the
    # connection.
    # Default: 30
    #
    # ListenAddress = ":19704"
    # MaxEventStreamClients = 100
    # EventStreamKeepAliveIntervalSeconds = 30

[HTTPServer.Auth]
    # Required service credential used by huatuo-apiserver.
    BearerToken = "REPLACE_WITH_RANDOM_HEX"

# Shared lifecycle policy for Profiling and Tracing operations.
[Operations]
    # MaxConcurrent = 10
    # LaunchTimeoutSeconds = 10
    # StopGracePeriodSeconds = 5
    # FinalizationTimeoutSeconds = 30
    # TerminalRetentionPeriodSeconds = 600

# Node-local profiler execution settings.
[Profiling]
    # AggregationIntervalSeconds = 10
    # MaxConcurrentProcesses = 10
    # CommandOutputLimitBytes = 65536
    # ToolDir = "/opt/huatuo/tools"

```

- **ListenAddress** uses `host:port` form. An empty host listens on all
  interfaces.
- **HTTPServer.Auth.BearerToken** is required and must match the independent
  Node credential configured for huatuo-apiserver. Replace the example value
  before deployment.
- **Operations.MaxConcurrent** is one process-wide limit shared by Profiling
  and Tracing. New operations are rejected instead of queued when it is full.
- The four operation time settings independently limit process launch,
  graceful stop, result finalization, and terminal-state retention.
- **Profiling.ToolDir** is the shared external tool root, passed unchanged as
  profiler `--tool-path`. Java requires `bin/asprof` and
  `lib/libasyncProfiler.so` beneath this root; Python requires
  `py-spy`. Only the requested language's tools are checked. Native profiling
  does not require this setting. Unsupported node environments reject the request
  without creating an operation.

The generated Node API exposes its contract at `GET /openapi.json`. Profiling
and Tracing Start, Get, and Stop routes, `POST /v1/events/watch`, and
`PUT /v1/config` require the service bearer token. `/readyz`, metrics, version,
and the OpenAPI document remain public.

#### 5.1 Update Configuration through the Node API

`PUT /v1/config` accepts one non-empty `config` object. Keys use the same
dot-separated paths as the TOML structure, while values retain their JSON
types:

```bash
curl -i -X PUT 'http://127.0.0.1:19704/v1/config' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer REPLACE_WITH_RANDOM_HEX' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "config": {
      "BlackList": ["dropwatch", "netdev_hw"],
      "Runtime.CPULimitCores": 1.5,
      "Runtime.MemoryLimitMiB": 1024
    }
  }'
```

A successful update returns `204 No Content`. The Node Agent validates the
complete candidate configuration, atomically replaces the configuration file,
and only then publishes the new in-memory snapshot. Validation or persistence
failure leaves the current snapshot unchanged. Unknown keys, invalid value
types, and empty update objects return `400 Bad Request`.

Components that read configuration dynamically can observe the new snapshot
without a restart. Settings consumed during startup, including the HTTP
listener and authentication, storage initialization, and cgroup setup, are
persisted but take effect only after restarting `huatuo-bamai`.

The event stream settings control `POST /v1/events/watch`. When
`MaxEventStreamClients` is reached, new streams receive HTTP 429.
`EventStreamKeepAliveIntervalSeconds` controls SSE heartbeat comments used to
keep proxy and load-balancer connections alive. After three consecutive write
failures, the server closes the stream. Set the interval below any upstream
idle timeout; 15–60 seconds is typical.

### 6. Storage

#### 6.1 Elasticsearch and OpenSearch Storage

```bash
# Storage configuration
[Storage]
    # Elasticsearch and OpenSearch Storage
    #
    # Disable ES/OS storage if one of Address, Username, Password is empty.
    # Store the tracing and events data of linux kernel to ES/OS.
    #
    # - Address
    # Port 9200 is commonly used for Elasticsearch/OpenSearch HTTP APIs.
    # e.g.
    # http://127.0.0.1:9200
    # https://127.0.0.1:9200
    #
    # - Index
    # Elasticsearch or OpenSearch index, a logical namespace that holds a collection of
    # documents for huatuo-bamai.
    # Default: huatuo_bamai
    #
    # - Username
    # - Password
    # Address, Username, and Password must be either all empty (disabled) or
    # all configured (enabled). Partial connection settings are invalid.
    #
    [Storage.Elasticsearch]
        # Address = "http://127.0.0.1:9200"
        # Index = "huatuo_bamai"
        # Username = "elastic"
        # Password = "REPLACE_WITH_PASSWORD"
```

- **Address**: ElasticSearch/OpenSearch service address.

  No default value.

  **Description**: Used to store kernel tracing and event data. ES/OS storage
  is disabled when Address, Username, and Password are all empty. All three
  values are required when storage is enabled; a partial configuration
  prevents startup.

- **Index**: Index name.

  Default: huatuo_bamai.

  **Description**: Logical namespace for organizing huatuo-bamai tracing and event documents.

- **Username**: Authentication username.

  No default value.

  **Description**: Used for Basic Auth.

- **Password**: Authentication password.

  No default value.

  **Description**: Used together with the username. In production, use a strong password and enable TLS encryption.

**Overall**: ES/OS storage persists kernel tracing and event data for later search and analysis.

#### 6.2 Local File Storage

```bash
# LocalFile Storage
#
# Store data to local directory for troubleshooting on the host machine.
#
# - Path
# The directory for storing data. If the Path is empty, LocalFile will be disabled.
# Default: "huatuo-local"
#
# - RotationSizeMiB
# The maximum size in Megabytes of a record file before it gets rotated
# per kernel tracer.
# Default: 100MB
#
# - MaxRotatedFiles
# The maximum number of old log files to retain for per tracer.
# Default: 10
#
[Storage.LocalFile]
    # Path = "huatuo-local"
    # RotationSizeMiB = 100
    # MaxRotatedFiles = 10
```

- **Path**: Local data storage directory.

  Default: huatuo-local. If empty, local file storage is disabled.

  **Description**: Stores data locally on the host for on-site troubleshooting. Use an absolute path.

- **RotationSizeMiB**: Single file rotation size.

  Maximum size of a record file before rotation (per tracer).

  Default: 100 MB.

  **Description**: Prevents any single file from growing too large and consuming excessive disk space.

- **MaxRotatedFiles**: Maximum number of rotated files to retain.

  Default: 10.

  **Description**: Oldest files are automatically deleted once the limit is reached, controlling disk usage.

### 7. Automatic Tracing

The automatic tracing module is one of HUATUO’s intelligent features. It triggers specific performance tracing based on thresholds, reducing manual intervention.

#### 7.1 CPUIdle Automatic Tracing — Sudden High CPU Usage in Containers

    # Default: 45%
    #
    # - DeltaSysThreshold
    # The range of this system cpu changes within a short period of time.
    # Default: 20%
    #

    # Default: 55%
    #
    # - Interval
    # The sample interval of the cpu usage for all containers.
    # Default: 10s
    #
    # - IntervalTracing
    # Time since last run. Avoid frequently executing this tracing to prevent
    # performance impact.
    # Default: 1800s
    #
    # - RunTracingToolTimeout
    # Execution timeout of this tracing tool (seconds).
    # Default: 10s
    # 
# NOTE:
# Profiling triggers when:
# 1. UserThreshold AND DeltaUserThreshold are exceeded, or
# 2. SysThreshold AND DeltaSysThreshold are exceeded, or
# 3. UsageThreshold AND DeltaUsageThreshold are exceeded
    #
    [AutoTracing.CPUIdle]
        # UserThreshold = 75
        # SysThreshold = 45
        # UsageThreshold = 90
        # DeltaUserThreshold = 45
        # DeltaSysThreshold = 20
        # DeltaUsageThreshold = 55
        # Interval = 10
        # IntervalTracing = 1800
        # RunTracingToolTimeout = 10
```

- **UserThreshold**: User-mode CPU usage threshold (%).

  Default: 75%.

  Default: 45%.

- **UsageThreshold**: Total CPU usage threshold (%).

  Default: 90% (as shown in comments).

- **DeltaUserThreshold**: Short-term user CPU change threshold (%).

  Default: 45%.

- **DeltaSysThreshold**: Short-term system CPU change threshold (%).

  Default: 20%.

- **DeltaUsageThreshold**: Short-term total CPU change threshold (%).

  Default: 55%.

- **Interval**: CPU usage sampling interval (seconds).

  Default: 10s.

- **RunTracingToolTimeout**: Single tracing execution timeout (seconds).

  Default: 10s.

**Trigger Logic**: Tracing runs when any of the following is true:

1. Both UserThreshold and DeltaUserThreshold are met, or
2. Both SysThreshold and DeltaSysThreshold are met, or
3. Both UsageThreshold and DeltaUsageThreshold are met.

**Filter Container Filtering**: Use Included/Excluded rule arrays to control monitoring scope.

```bash
    # Each rule contains Field (filter field) and Pattern (regex).
    # Field: container_host_namespace | container_hostname | container_qos
    #
    # [[AutoTracing.CPUIdle.Filter.Excluded]]
    #     Field = "container_qos"
    #     Pattern = "besteffort"
    # [[AutoTracing.CPUIdle.Filter.Included]]
    #     Field = "container_host_namespace"
    #     Pattern = "^application-"
```

- **Filter**: Container filtering rules. Defined using `[[double-bracket]]` syntax with multiple rules, each containing `Field` (filter field) and `Pattern` (regex). Filtering logic:

  - No rules: monitor all containers
  - `Excluded` only: blacklist, skip matched containers
  - `Included` only: whitelist, only monitor matched containers
  - Both: must match Included AND not match Excluded

  Default: no rules, all containers monitored.

#### 7.2 CPUSys Automatic Tracing — Sudden High System CPU on Host

```bash
# cpusys

#### 7.5 MemoryBurst AutoTracing

This module detects sudden memory usage spikes on the host and automatically captures kernel context to help diagnose memory pressure events.

```bash
# memory burst
#
# Capture kernel context on sudden host memory usage spikes.
#
# - Interval
# Memory usage sampling interval (seconds).
# Default: 10s
#

# Default: 100%
#
# - DeltaAnonThreshold

- **DumpProcessMaxNum**: Maximum processes to dump on trigger.

  Default: 10.

- **SnapshotProcessMaxNum**: Maximum ranked processes to capture runtime snapshots for. Must be positive; the actual count is capped by `DumpProcessMaxNum` and available ranked processes.

  Default: 3.

#### 7.6 Memory Threshold Runtime Snapshots

`memory_threshold_snapshot` is enabled by default. Add it to the global `BlackList`
and restart huatuo-bamai to disable it.
This feature attempts a Go, HotSpot, or CPython snapshot
after a container memory-pressure notification; completion before OOM is not
guaranteed. Candidates are ranked by an approximate kernel OOM score.

The persisted `victim_pid`, `victim_process_name`, and `victim_oom_score_adj`
fields describe the process selected for snapshot capture.

```toml
[AutoTracing.MemoryThresholdSnapshot]
    # ThresholdPercent = 90
    # IntervalTracing = 300
    # RunTracingToolTimeout = 2
    # MaxMemoryObjectEntries = 10
```

Commented values are defaults.

| Parameter | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| ThresholdPercent | Required memory usage-to-limit percentage, from 1 to 100 |
| IntervalTracing | Node-wide minimum interval after a successful or failed capture attempt, in seconds; defaults to 300 and must be positive |
| RunTracingToolTimeout | Cooperative capture timeout shared by Go, Java, and Python, in seconds; defaults to 2 and must be positive |
| MaxMemoryObjectEntries | Maximum number of ranked memory object entries in a snapshot, from 1 to 100; defaults to 10; final JSON is trimmed to at most 512 KiB |

Runtime detection and persistence are not included in the capture budget.
Runtime detection has no separate timeout. Timeouts cannot interrupt synchronous reads
already executing, so they do not bound the total operation time.

**Trigger conditions:**

- **Cgroup v1**: Registers the memory threshold corresponding to
  `ThresholdPercent` through `cgroup.event_control`.
- **Cgroup v2**: Watches increases in the `high` or `max` counters of
  `memory.events.local` (falling back to `memory.events` when absent), then
  checks `memory.current / memory.max` against the configured percentage.
  This feature does not set `memory.high`. When it is `max`, the hard-limit
  `max` counter can still trigger a check. This is a late notification and
  does not guarantee detection at the configured percentage or before OOM.

Both versions check usage once after registration and when the hard limit
changes. One watcher manages all targets without periodic sampling. Repeated
notifications for a target are coalesced; they do not count every crossing or
report recovery below the threshold. Capture rechecks current usage and identity.

This feature requires the pod manager. It actively maintains the container view
from shared CSS lifecycle hints and supplies an initial view followed by events
with instance generations, init PIDs, and memory cgroup paths. The snapshot module
no longer scans the cgroup tree. Subscription overflow recovers from a complete
pod view; synchronization failure suspends capture and never implies deletion.

Running ordinary containers and restartable init sidecars are monitored;
ephemeral debug containers and ordinary init containers are excluded. Ordinary
registration errors and target capacity exhaustion are logged and the directory
instance is skipped. Invalidated registrations are removed without automatic
retries or backfilling. Repeated events, full views, and container generation changes
do not restore a failed watch. A replacement directory, a new tracking lifetime
after the previous container departs, or a huatuo-bamai restart allows a new attempt.
Fatal errors such as host resource exhaustion still stop the current watcher.
Each monitored container must have its own memory cgroup directory. A watch
and its capture observations bind directly to one container instance. If registration
returns a watch already owned by another container, the feature stops, cancels capture,
and releases its watches. Correct the cgroup isolation and restart huatuo-bamai;
the feature does not retry this conflict. Directory replacement invalidates the old
registration through the watcher's removal notification.
Before capture and saving, the feature verifies the container generation and live
binding, directory identity, and selected process identity and cgroup membership.
Recorded memory usage and limits belong to that container's cgroup.

See section 14 for deployment limitations and output lookup.

#### 7.7 IRQTracing AutoTracing

This module detects abnormal irq+softirq utilization on one CPU and invokes
`irqtracing` to collect softirq source and victim stacks.

```bash
[AutoTracing.IRQTracing]
    Interval = 2
    RunTracingToolTimeout = 3
    IntervalTracing = 300
    MaxEventsPerSecond = 1000
    MinCPUs = 3
    DeltaUsageThreshold = 20
    RelativeIncreaseThreshold = 30
    SustainedIntervals = 10
    UsageThreshold = 80
```

- **Interval**: Sampling interval for per-CPU irq+softirq utilization from
  `/proc/stat`. Default: 2s.
- **RunTracingToolTimeout**: Duration of one `irqtracing` collection. Default:
  3s.
- **IntervalTracing**: Minimum interval between triggers. Default: 300s.
- **MaxEventsPerSecond**: Combined source and victim stack-sample limit per
  second on the traced CPU. Default: 1000. The daemon divides it as evenly as
  possible between `softirq_raise` and `softirq_entry`; the default is 500
  events/s per stream. The value must be between 2 and 8589934590.
- **MinCPUs**, **DeltaUsageThreshold**, and **RelativeIncreaseThreshold**:
  Configure the multi-CPU irq+softirq spike rule. The two thresholds are the
  increase in percentage points and the increase relative to the previous
  sample, respectively.
- **SustainedIntervals** and **UsageThreshold**: Configure the consecutive
  sample count and utilization threshold for the single-CPU sustained rule.

#### 7.8 Known Issue Filtering (IssuesList)

```bash
# Autotracing configuration.
#
# - IssuesList
# Known issue filters for autotracing.
#
[AutoTracing]
    IssuesList = []
```

- **IssuesList**: Known issue filter. Format: `[["name", "regex"], ...]`. When a collected stack trace matches the regex, it is labeled with the issue name. Default `[]`.

  Example: `IssuesList = [["known_issue1", "softlockup"], ["known_issue2", "alloc_pages.*failed"]]`

**Note**: Only supports `dload` tracing of known issues filtering, other events are not supported.

### 8. Event Tracing

This section captures key kernel events and latency, including scheduler tick intervals, memory reclaim, network receive latency, network device events, and packet drops. It is the core module for kernel-level anomaly context collection in HUATUO.

#### 8.1 Scheduler Tick Interval Tracing

```bash
# linux kernel events capturing configuration
[EventTracing]
	# scheduler tick
	#
	# Trace long scheduler tick intervals.
	#
	# - IntervalThreshold
	# When the scheduler tick interval reaches the threshold, huatuo-bamai
	# will collect kernel context.
	# Default: 10000000 in nanoseconds, 10ms
	#
	[EventTracing.SchedTick]
		# IntervalThreshold = 10000000
```

- **IntervalThreshold**: Scheduler tick interval threshold, in nanoseconds.

  Default: 10,000,000 ns (10ms).

  **Description**: The event infers CPU stalls from long scheduler tick intervals. It does not by itself prove that softirqs were disabled.

#### 8.2 Memory Reclaim Blocking Tracing

```bash
# memreclaim
#
# The memory reclaim may block the process, if one process is blocked
# for a long time, reporting the events to userspace.
#
# - BlockedThreshold
# The blocked time when memory reclaiming.
# Default: 900000000ns, 900ms
#
[EventTracing.MemoryReclaim]
	# BlockedThreshold = 900000000
```

- **BlockedThreshold**: Memory reclaim blocking time threshold (nanoseconds).

  Default: 900,000,000 ns (900ms). When a process is blocked by memory reclaim for longer than this time, an event is reported to userspace with context.

  **Description**: Memory reclaim blocking is a common cause of process stalls, especially in memory-constrained cloud-native environments.

#### 8.3 Network Receive Latency Tracing

```bash
# networking rx latency
#
# linux net stack rx latency for every tcp skbs.
#
# - Driver2NetRx
# The latency from driver to net rx, e.g., netif_receive_skb.
# Default: 5ms
#
# - Driver2TCP
# The latency from driver to tcp rx, e.g., tcp_v4_rcv.
# Default: 10ms
#
# - Driver2Userspace
# The latency from driver to userspace copy data, e.g., skb_copy_datagram_iovec.
# Default: 115ms
#
# - ExcludedContainerQos
# Blacklist: skip containers whose qos level matches.
# Values: "guaranteed", "burstable", "besteffort" (case-insensitive).
# Default: [].
#
# - ExcludedHostNetnamespace
# Exclude packets in the host network namespace.
# Default: true
#
[EventTracing.NetRxLatency]
	# Driver2NetRx = 5
	# Driver2TCP = 10
	# Driver2Userspace = 115
	# ExcludedContainerQos = []
	ExcludedContainerQos = ["besteffort"]
	# ExcludedHostNetnamespace = true
```

- **Driver2NetRx**: Latency threshold from driver to network receive layer (e.g., netif_receive_skb).

  Default: 5ms.

- **Driver2TCP**: Latency threshold from driver to TCP receive (e.g., tcp_v4_rcv).

  Default: 10ms.

- **Driver2Userspace**: Latency threshold from driver to userspace data copy (e.g., skb_copy_datagram_iovec).

  Default: 115ms.

- **ExcludedContainerQos**: Container QoS levels to exclude (blacklist).

  Default: []. Corresponds to Kubernetes Pod QoS levels (Guaranteed, Burstable, BestEffort).

- **ExcludedHostNetnamespace**: Whether to exclude packets in the host network namespace.

  Default: true.

#### 8.4 Network Device Event Monitoring

```bash
# netdev events
#
# Monitor network device events.
#
# - DeviceList
# The net devices we monitor.
# Default: [] (empty, meaning no devices).
#
[EventTracing.Netdev]
	DeviceList = ["eth0", "eth1", "bond4", "lo"]
```

- **DeviceList**: List of network device full-match regex patterns to monitor. Literal names such as `"eth0"` keep exact-match behavior; patterns such as `"bond[0-9]+"` can select multiple devices.

  Default example includes "eth0", "eth1", "bond4", "lo". An empty list means no devices are monitored.

  **Description**: Monitors physical link status events for specified network interfaces.

#### 8.5 Packet Drop Monitoring

```toml
[EventTracing.Dropwatch]
    # Filter for standalone dropwatch.
    # Default: "tcp"
    Filter = "tcp"

    # Forwarded to dropwatch --max-events-per-second.
    # Default: 100; 0 disables rate limiting.
    MaxEventsPerSecond = 100

    # Reserved configuration field. It is not currently consumed by the
    # dropwatch event path and therefore has no filtering effect.
    # Default: []
    ExcludeContainers = []
```

- **Filter**: tcpdump-style packet filter passed only to standalone dropwatch. TCP retransmission correlation uses `TCPRetransmit.Filter` for both of its inputs.

  Default: `"tcp"`.

- **MaxEventsPerSecond**: Maximum number of dropwatch events emitted by BPF per second.

  Default: `100`. Set to `0` to disable rate limiting.

- **ExcludeContainers**: Reserved container-exclusion list.

  Default: `[]`. The field exists in the configuration schema, but the current dropwatch event path does not read or forward it, so configuring it has no effect. Use `EventTracing.IssuesList` for operator-defined dropwatch call-stack suppression.

#### 8.6 TCP Retransmission Tracing ([EventTracing.TCPRetransmit])

```bash
[EventTracing.TCPRetransmit]
    # Retransmission filter. Local correlation applies it to both inputs.
    # Default: empty (no flag when disabled; "tcp" when enabled).
    Filter = ""

    # Forwarded as tcpshark --enable-tlp. Default: false.
    EnableTLP = false

    # Run tcpshark with an embedded dropwatch source. Default: false.
    EnableDropwatch = false

    # Forwarded as tcpshark --max-events-per-second.
    # Default: 100; 0 disables rate limiting.
    MaxEventsPerSecond = 100
```

- **EnableTLP**: Whether to collect `tcp_send_loss_probe` events.

  Default: false.

- **Filter**: Tcpdump-style retransmission filter used in both modes. Local correlation applies the normalized expression to both tcpshark inputs and defaults an empty value to `tcp`. When correlation is disabled, an empty value passes no `--filter` flag. `Dropwatch.Filter` independently controls standalone dropwatch.

- **EnableDropwatch**: Whether tcpshark should load a private dropwatch source and finalize retransmissions locally. The default is false. `tcp_retransmit` must be removed from `BlackList`; standalone `dropwatch` may remain blacklisted. Retransmissions wait up to 100 ms for delayed delivery, and candidate drops must precede them by no more than one second in kernel monotonic time. The embedded source automatically detects and enables devlink DROP traps. A strict same-namespace match reports `software` or `hardware` according to source, with the same `drop_source`, `drop_reason`, and hardware `drop_reason_group` semantics as dropwatch; every finalized event has one `correlation_reason` (`matched`, `unsupported`, `warmup`, `wait_timeout`, `queue_full`, or `interrupted`). `warmup` applies only to expired waits whose retransmit timestamp predates source readiness; retransmissions at or after readiness receive `wait_timeout` on expiry, and other termination paths retain their own reasons. Unmatched events report `drop_location=unknown` with the namespace diagnostic and dropwatch counters, including map-counter availability.

- **MaxEventsPerSecond**: Maximum TCP retransmission events emitted by BPF per second. Correlation mode gives embedded dropwatch an independent limiter with the same value, so `100` permits up to 100 events/s on each input.

  Default: 100. Set to 0 for unlimited output. When the limit is exceeded, `tcpshark` logs `rate limit hit`.

#### 8.7 Hardware Error Event Tracing (EventTracing.Ras)

```bash
# ras
#
# Hardware error event tracing (RAS: Reliability, Availability, Serviceability).
# Captures MCE, EDAC, ACPI/GHES, PCIe AER, and MCE threshold (THR) events via eBPF.
#
# - MceThrBackoff
# Minimum interval in seconds between consecutive MCE threshold (THR) event saves.
# THR events are fired by the local-APIC threshold interrupt and can storm at high
# frequency; this cooldown prevents flooding storage with redundant records.
# Default: 1800s (30 minutes)
#
[EventTracing.Ras]
    # MceThrBackoff = 1800
```

- **MceThrBackoff**: Minimum cooldown in seconds between MCE threshold (THR) event saves.

  Default: 1800s (30 minutes).

  **Description**: THR events are generated by the CPU's local-APIC threshold interrupt when correctable hardware errors accumulate. These can fire at very high frequency during hardware degradation. The backoff suppresses redundant saves while ensuring at least one record is captured per interval. Lower values provide more granular event records at the cost of higher storage throughput; in environments with frequent correctable errors, consider raising this value to reduce noise.

#### 8.8 Moore Threads GPU Event Tracing (EventTracing.MthreadsGPU)

```bash
# mthreads_gpu
#
# Moore Threads GPU XID error event tracing.
[EventTracing.MthreadsGPU]
    # MthreadsXidLevel = ""
```

- **MthreadsXidLevel**: Minimum severity level for XID error reporting.

  Valid values: `""` (disabled), `"notify"`, `"warning"`, `"fatal"`.

  Default: `""` (disabled).

  **Description**: Controls which XID error events are reported. Set to enable XID error tracking for Moore Threads GPUs. XID errors below the specified severity level are filtered out. To enable this feature, ensure that `mthreads_xid` is removed from the global `BlackList` (if present) and set this field to one of the valid severity levels (`"notify"`, `"warning"`, `"fatal"`). Additionally, the MUSA driver must be installed on the host. The feature polls `/proc/driver/musa/gpu*/event_report` files every second to capture XID error events. Each XID event contains detailed information including UUID, XID ID, severity, scope, PCI BDF, process ID, and additional context.

#### 8.9 Known Issue Filtering (IssuesList)

```bash
# Linux kernel event tracing configuration.
#
# - IssuesList
# Known issue filters for event tracing.
#
[EventTracing]
    IssuesList = []
```

- **IssuesList**: Known-issue suppression rules in the form `[["name", "regex"], ...]`. Default `[]`.

  For `net_rx_latency`, each regex is matched against the generated event title. For `dropwatch`, it is matched against the newline-joined kernel call stack. A match causes the event to be discarded; the configured name identifies the rule but is not added to the saved event.

  Example: `IssuesList = [["ignored_process", "comm=ignored_process"], ["neighbor_cleanup", "neigh_invalidate/"]]`

### 9. Metric Collector

This section defines collection rules for various system and network metrics. All `Included`/`Excluded` fields share the same filter logic (regex):

- No rules: all items are collected
- Excluded only: blacklist, matched items are skipped
- Included only: whitelist, only matched items are collected
- Both: must match Included AND not match Excluded

#### 9.1 Netdev Statistics

```bash
# Metric Collector
[MetricCollector]
	# Netdev statistic
	#
	# - EnableNetlink
	# Use netlink instead of procfs net/dev to get netdev statistic.
	# Only support the host environment to use `netlink` now.
	# Default is "false".
	#
	# - DeviceIncluded
	# Accept special devices in netdev statistic.
	# Default: "" (empty), meaning include all.
	#
	# - DeviceExcluded
	# Exclude special devices in netdev statistic.
	# Default: "" (empty), meaning exclude nothing.
	#
	# Filter logic see MetricCollector section header.
	#
	[MetricCollector.NetdevStats]
		# EnableNetlink = false
		# DeviceIncluded = ""
		DeviceExcluded = "^(lo)|(docker\\w*)|(veth\\w*)$"
```

- **EnableNetlink**: Use netlink instead of procfs to collect netdev statistics.

  Default: false. Currently only supported on the host.

- **DeviceIncluded**: Regex to include specific devices. Default: include all.

- **DeviceExcluded**: Regex to exclude devices. Example: "^(lo)|(docker\\w*)|(veth\\w*)$", meaning exclude loopback, docker, and veth interfaces.

#### 9.2 Netdev DCB Collection

```bash
# netdev dcb, DCB (Data Center Bridging)
#
# Collecting the DCB PFC (Priority-based Flow Control).
#
# - DeviceList
# The net devices we monitor.
# Default: [] (empty, meaning no devices).
#
[MetricCollector.NetdevDCB]
	DeviceList = ["eth0", "eth1"]
```

- **DeviceList**: List of network device full-match regex patterns for which DCB (Data Center Bridging) PFC information is collected.

#
# Collecting the hardware statistic of net devices, e.g, rx_dropped.
#
# - DeviceList

#
[MetricCollector.NetdevHW]
	DeviceList = ["eth0", "eth1"]
```

  Default: empty.

#### 9.4 Qdisc Collection

```bash
# Qdisc
#
# - DeviceIncluded / DeviceExcluded
# Same as above.
#
[MetricCollector.Qdisc]
	# DeviceIncluded = ""
	DeviceExcluded = "^(lo)|(docker\\w*)|(veth\\w*)$"
```

- **DeviceIncluded / DeviceExcluded**: Same as above.

#### 9.5 vmstat Metric Collection

```bash
# vmstat
#
# This metric supports host vmstat and cgroup vmstat.
# - IncludedOnHost / ExcludedOnHost: same as above, for host /proc/vmstat.
# - IncludedOnContainer / ExcludedOnContainer: same, for cgroup containers memory.stat.
#
[MetricCollector.Vmstat]
	IncludedOnHost = "allocstall|nr_active_anon|nr_active_file|nr_boost_pages|nr_dirty|nr_free_pages|nr_inactive_anon|nr_inactive_file|nr_kswapd_boost|nr_mlock|nr_shmem|nr_slab_reclaimable|nr_slab_unreclaimable|nr_unevictable|nr_writeback|numa_pages_migrated|pgdeactivate|pgrefill|pgscan_direct|pgscan_kswapd|pgsteal_direct|pgsteal_kswapd"
	ExcludedOnHost = "total"
	IncludedOnContainer = "active_anon|active_file|dirty|inactive_anon|inactive_file|pgdeactivate|pgrefill|pgscan_direct|pgscan_kswapd|pgsteal_direct|pgsteal_kswapd|shmem|unevictable|writeback|pgscan_globaldirect|pgscan_globalkswapd|pgscan_cswapd|pgsteal_cswapd|pgsteal_globaldirect|pgsteal_globalkswapd"
	ExcludedOnContainer = "total"
```

- **IncludedOnHost / ExcludedOnHost**: Filter fields for host /proc/vmstat.

- **IncludedOnContainer / ExcludedOnContainer**: Filter fields for container cgroup memory.stat.

#### 9.6 Other Metric Collections

```bash
# MemoryEvents/Netstat/MountPointStat
#
# - Included / Excluded: same as above.
# - MountPointsIncluded: whitelist only (no Excluded), same logic.
#
[MetricCollector.MemoryEvents]
	Included = "watermark_inc|watermark_dec"
	# Excluded = ""
[MetricCollector.Netstat]
	# Excluded = ""
	# Included = ""

# MountPointStat
[MetricCollector.MountPointStat]
	MountPointsIncluded = "(^/home$)|(^/$)|(^/boot$)"
```

- **Included / Excluded**: Same as above.

- **MountPointsIncluded**: Regex for mount points to collect. Default includes /, /home, /boot.

#### 9.7 Moore Threads GPU Metrics

```bash
# MetricCollector.Mthreads
#
# Moore Threads GPU metric collection via the MTML (Moore Threads Management
# Library) shared library. The library is discovered automatically at startup
# using SONAME search (libmtml.so.2, then libmtml.so) through the system
# dynamic linker; no hardcoded path is required.
#
# Remove "mthreads_gpu" from BlackList to enable this collector.
#
# - EnableHealth
# Enable health metrics: temperature, power, utilization, clocks, fans, pstate, VPU.
# Default: true
#
# - EnablePCIe
# Enable PCIe link metrics: current speed/width and replay counter.
# Default: false
#
# - EnableMTLink
# Enable MtLink interconnect metrics: per-link state and bandwidth.
# Default: false
#
[MetricCollector.Mthreads]
    # EnableHealth = true
    # EnablePCIe = false
    # EnableMTLink = false
```

- **EnableHealth**: Controls collection of health-related metrics.

  Default: true. When enabled, collects: GPU/memory temperature (`gpu_temperature_celsius`, `memory_temperature_celsius`), power usage and limits (`device_power_watts`, `gpu_power_limit_watts`, `gpu_power_default_limit_watts`), GPU/memory utilization (`gpu_utilization_percent`, `memory_utilization_percent`), clock frequencies (`gpu_clock_mhz`, `gpu_max_clock_mhz`, `memory_clock_mhz`, `memory_max_clock_mhz`), voltage (`gpu_voltage_volts`), memory capacity (`memory_total_bytes`, `memory_used_bytes`), fan speed (`fan_rpm`, `fan_speed_percent`), performance state (`gpu_pstate`), and VPU metrics (`vpu_utilization_percent`, `vpu_encoder_utilization_percent`, `vpu_decoder_utilization_percent`, `vpu_clock_mhz`).

- **EnablePCIe**: Controls collection of PCIe link metrics.

  Default: false. When enabled, collects: current PCIe link speed and width (`pcie_link_speed_gt_per_sec`, `pcie_link_width_lanes`), max capability (`pcie_link_max_speed_gt_per_sec`, `pcie_link_max_width_lanes`), and replay counter (`pcie_replay_total`).

- **EnableMTLink**: Controls collection of MtLink interconnect metrics.

  Default: false. When enabled, collects: device-level static specs (per-link bandwidth `mtlink_link_bandwidth_gb_s` and link count `mtlink_link_count`) and per-link state (`mtlink_state`).

**Library discovery**: At startup, the collector searches for `libmtml.so.2` then `libmtml.so` via the system dynamic linker (respecting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `/etc/ld.so.cache`). If no library is found, the collector logs a warning and is disabled for the lifetime of the process. Library discovery is performed only at startup: changing `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or installing a new MTML version also requires a restart.

**Hot-reload semantics**: `EnableHealth`, `EnablePCIe`, and `EnableMTLink` are read from the latest config snapshot on every scrape, so toggling them takes effect on the next Prometheus scrape without restarting `huatuo-bamai`. A `false → true → false` transition emits and suppresses the corresponding metric groups on the next scrape after each change.

Note: enabling the collector itself (i.e. removing `mthreads_gpu` from `BlackList` after the process has already started with the collector disabled because `libmtml.so` was missing at startup) requires a restart. The collector factory runs only during initialization, so a successful late library load will not register a new collector.

### 10. Pod

This section configures how to fetch Pod information from kubelet to enable container/Pod-level labeling and metric isolation.

```bash
# Pod Configuration
#
# Configure these parameters for fetching pods from kubelet.
#
# - KubeletReadOnlyPort
# The KubeletReadOnlyPort is kubelet read-only port for the Kubelet to serve on with
# no authentication/authorization. The port number must be between 1 and 65535, inclusive.
# Setting this field to 0 disables fetching pods from kubelet read-only service.
# Default: 10255
#
# - KubeletAuthorizedPort
# The port is the HTTPs port of the kubelet. The port number must be between 1 and 65535,
# inclusive. Setting this field to 0 disables fetching pods from kubelet HTTPS port.
# Default: 10250
#
# - KubeletClientCertPath
# https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/best-practices/certificates/
#
# Client certificate and private key file name. One file or two files:
# "/path/to/xxx-kubelet-client.crt,/path/to/xxx-kubelet-client.key",
# "/path/to/kubelet-client-current.pem"
#
# You can disable this kubelet fetching pods, for bare metal service, by
# KubeletReadOnlyPort = 0, and KubeletAuthorizedPort = 0.
#
[Pod]
	KubeletClientCertPath = "/etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-kubelet-client.crt,/etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-kubelet-client.key"
```

- **KubeletReadOnlyPort**: Kubelet read-only port.

  Default: 10255. Set to 0 to disable this method.

- **KubeletAuthorizedPort**: Kubelet HTTPS authorized port.

  Default: 10250. Set to 0 to disable.

- **KubeletClientCertPath**: Path to kubelet client certificate and private key. Supports comma-separated files or single PEM file.

  **Description**: Used for mTLS authentication on the HTTPS port. In non-Kubernetes (bare-metal) environments, set both ports to 0 to disable Pod fetching.

### 11. CLI Flags

`huatuo-bamai` supports the following command-line flags:

```bash
huatuo-bamai --region <region> [options]
```

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--config` | Configuration file name | `huatuo-bamai.conf` |
| `--config-dir` | Configuration file directory | `conf` |
| `--bpf-dir` | BPF object file directory | `bpf` |
| `--tools-bin-dir` | Tracing tool binary directory | `bin` |
| `--region` | Deployment region (required) | - |
| `--disable-kubelet` | Disable kubelet Pod fetching | `false` |
| `--disable-storage` | Disable storage backends | `false` |
| `--enable-cgroup` | Enable self cgroup resource limits (disabled by default) | `false` |
| `--disable-tracing` | Disable specified tracing modules (may be repeated) | - |
| `--log-debug` | Force log level to Debug | `false` |
| `--dry-run` | Load-only test; exit gracefully after startup | `false` |
| `--procfs-prefix` | procfs mount point prefix | - |

### 12. Configuration Override Precedence

When the same configuration item is set in both command-line flags and the configuration file, the following precedence applies:

**CLI flag > Configuration file > Built-in default**

Specific rules:

1. **Log level**: `--log-debug` > config file `[Log] Level` > built-in default `Info`
   - `--log-debug` has the highest priority and forces the log level to `Debug` regardless of the `Level` value in the configuration file.
   - An explicit `Level` in the configuration file overrides the built-in default.
   - If neither is set, the default `Info` is used.

2. **Tracing blacklist**: `--disable-tracing` is merged with the configuration file `BlackList` (they complement each other rather than override).

3. **Other boolean switches** (`--disable-kubelet`, `--disable-storage`): When explicitly set on the command line, they override the configuration file.

### 13. Best Practices and Important Notes

- **Resource Control**: Kubernetes uses Pod resources and systemd uses service limits.
  Use `--enable-cgroup` and `[Runtime]` only for direct execution without an
  external manager.
- **Storage Choice**: For small-scale deployments, prefer [Storage.LocalFile] for local troubleshooting. For large clusters, configure Elasticsearch for centralized storage and querying.
- **AutoTracing Tuning**: Adjust thresholds based on workload characteristics. Thresholds that are too low cause frequent triggering; thresholds that are too high may miss issues. Validate gradually in a test environment.
- **Security**: Use strong passwords for ES configuration and consider enabling HTTPS. Avoid hard-coding sensitive information in the configuration file.
- **Compatibility**: Configuration parameters may be affected by kernel version and hardware environment. Always verify with the official HUATUO documentation for your specific setup.

By properly configuring huatuo-bamai.conf, you can fully leverage HUATUO’s capabilities in kernel-level anomaly detection and intelligent tracing, significantly improving observability and troubleshooting efficiency in cloud-native systems.

If you need deeper customization for a specific scenario, feel free to provide more details about your environment.

### 14. Memory Threshold Snapshot Deployment and Troubleshooting

#### 14.1 Requirements and Limitations

- Requires Linux, memory cgroup v1/v2, host PID/procfs/cgroup views,
  kubelet metadata, kernel BTF, and BPF load/attach permissions.
- Requires target-memory read permission (usually `CAP_SYS_PTRACE`),
  procfs/cgroup access, and v1 `cgroup.event_control` write access.
  Yama, SELinux, or AppArmor may block access.
- Selects only direct cgroup members, excluding `oom_score_adj = -1000`.
  Selection is skipped above 4096 PIDs, 64 KiB of PID data, or a one-second budget.
- At most 4096 containers are watched. Targets come from pod events without
  scanning the cgroup tree. Ordinary registration errors and capacity exhaustion
  are logged and skipped; invalidated registrations are removed without retries
  or backfilling. Resource recovery or a full view does not re-register the same
  instance, so pressure monitoring may remain unavailable for that instance.
- Failed identity checks or missing container metadata prevent capture or saving.
- Process selection and capture both use `/proc` in Huatuo's PID namespace.
  Changing `--procfs-prefix` does not redirect memory snapshot reads.

This table describes experimental implementation coverage, not validation of
every listed version:

| Runtime | Experimental coverage | Main limitations |
|---------|-----------------------|------------------|
| Go | Go 1.18–1.26, 64-bit ELF | Instruction recovery for stripped executables is x86-64 only |
| Java | Java 8+, little-endian 64-bit ELF HotSpot, G1 GC | Requires recognizable VMStruct/VMType metadata |
| Python | CPython 3.8–3.14, little-endian 64-bit ELF | Requires discoverable `_PyRuntime` and recognizable version/layout |

Recorded manual validation: x86-64 Linux, cgroup v1 (legacy/hybrid), Go 1.24.0.
Verify pressure-triggered, non-empty snapshots in your environment;
skipped tests and `unavailable` results do not prove compatibility.

#### 14.2 Output and Troubleshooting

Info logs record watcher state and capture attempts.
Process selection and persistence details use Debug logs. Locate attempts by
container/cgroup and use process-selection logs to identify the PID. Inspect
stored snapshot `status` and `status_reason` fields for runtime diagnostics.
If a capture attempt starts but does not finish, inspect bamai's
`/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=2` with appropriate authorization for the blocked stack.
No logs alone do not prove that monitoring has stopped.

`tracer_data.process_memory` reads `/proc/<pid>/status` once after runtime detection
returns without error, including for unrecognized runtimes such as C/C++.
Provider failures produce a `failed` snapshot and retain this summary.
Detection or output-processing errors prevent persistence; inspect the capture
attempt logs for the error. Target identity changes or cancellation discard the result.
It provides no PSS, mapping rankings, or allocation stacks.

| Field (bytes) | Source / meaning |
|------|--------|
| `virtual_bytes` | VmSize, virtual address space, not physical memory usage |
| `rss_bytes` | VmRSS, resident memory |
| `rss_anon_bytes` | RssAnon, anonymous resident memory |
| `rss_file_bytes` | RssFile, file-backed resident memory |
| `rss_shmem_bytes` | RssShmem, shared resident memory |
| `swap_bytes` | VmSwap, swapped private anonymous memory, excluding shmem swap |
| `page_table_bytes` | VmPTE, page-table memory |

Missing/invalid fields are omitted, not zero-filled: status is `partial`,
or `unavailable` with `status_reason` if nothing can be read.
Values are approximate, not an OOM-time snapshot or proof of a leak.
The selected process may not be the eventual OOM victim.

Results use the existing `[Storage]` configuration (section 6); no separate
storage setup is needed. The LocalFile filename is `memory_threshold_snapshot`.
Query `tracing_documents` with `tracer_name = memory_threshold_snapshot` and
`tracer_type = autotracing`.

`started_timestamp` records when the capture attempt starts, before process selection.
`observed_timestamp` records when snapshot collection starts, after process selection
and before runtime detection.

The `kind` and measurement semantics of `tracer_data.snapshot.entries` are:

| Runtime | `kind` | `objects` | `bytes` |
|---------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Go | `inuse_space_objects` | Estimated unfreed object count from published statistics, corrected for sampling and grouped by complete allocation stack | Estimated unfreed bytes for those objects |
| Java | `object_class` | Estimated instance count grouped by class | Estimated memory occupied by the objects themselves (shallow heap) |
| Python | `gc_tracked_object_type` | GC-tracked object count grouped by type | Estimated shallow size of those objects |

Go's `bytes` and `objects` correspond to pprof's `inuse_space` and `inuse_objects`
metrics. Java does not compute retained heap; Python covers only GC-tracked
objects, not the entire Python heap. Older records may use `allocation_site`
for Go and `object_type` for Java; consumers reading historical records should
accept those values.

For Go entries, `name` remains the plain function name of the first non-runtime
frame, or the first frame when all frames belong to the runtime. `stack` remains
a string array ordered from the allocation site toward its callers. When both
file and line are available, each frame uses `function, source_file:line`, with
one space after the comma. For example:

```json
{
  "kind": "inuse_space_objects",
  "name": "example/cache.allocate",
  "bytes": 131072,
  "objects": 32,
  "average_bytes": 4096,
  "stack": [
    "example/cache.allocate, example/cache/cache.go:123",
    "example/service.load, example/service/load.go:58",
    "main.main, example/cmd/server/main.go:42"
  ]
}
```

Locations come from the binary's Go line table; source files need not exist on
the target machine. Paths retain their compiled values, which may reflect
`-trimpath` and may not identify files on the target machine. A missing file or
an invalid line leaves only the function name; an unresolved function leaves the
hexadecimal PC. Consumers should also accept historical frames containing only
names or addresses. Function names and paths may themselves contain commas, so
splitting indiscriminately on commas is not reliable. Source locations identify
allocation sites, not object owners, and do not guarantee a fully expanded
inline call chain.

Go subtracts frees from allocations using only the runtime's published `active`
counters, then corrects for sampling. Unpublished `future[0..2]` counters are
excluded. Publication is delayed until the corresponding GC sweep frees are
accounted for, so recent allocation spikes may be absent. Results are external
samples of the published heap profile, not heap usage at the trigger instant.
Collection does not acquire runtime locks, flush counters, or trigger GC in the
target. Fields or buckets may still reflect different publication stages, so
the result does not provide pprof's atomic consistency.

If a complete scan observes no nonzero `active` counters, it returns `unavailable`
with `status_reason` set to `Go heap profile has no published statistics`, without
falling back to `future`. This can occur before the first GC and does not mean
that the process has no heap objects. Published counters whose sampled objects
have all been freed can still produce `complete` with empty entries. An
interrupted scan preserves `partial` and its reason rather than treating
unobserved data as unpublished.

Go aggregates complete stack keys up to 32 frames for Go 1.18–1.22 and 1024 frames for Go 1.23–1.26; the shared output limit may shorten displayed stacks to 64 frames and sets `output_truncated`. An invalid bucket type, an excessive stack depth, or a cyclic bucket chain stops the scan with `partial`; repeated buckets are never counted twice.

Once a scan becomes partial, it stops traversing further buckets and selects at most `MaxMemoryObjectEntries` entries by descending byte count from the valid samples retained from earlier batches and the current batch, within the aggregation budget. The `status_reason` records only the first cause; finishing the current batch does not append further causes.

Any bucket header, record, or stack read failure, including a short read, fails the entire Go collection attempt and discards all runtime entries, including those from earlier batches. The collector reports `failed` with the read error; individual ranges are not retried.

Samples with a stack depth of zero produce no allocation-site entry; an empty stack alone does not make the scan `partial`.

Go snapshots require a known, enabled sampling rate and a nonempty bucket list. An unknown or disabled rate, or an empty bucket list, yields `unavailable` with a `status_reason` and no entries.

Go collection uses a single request timeout across runtime reads, scanning,
ranking, and entry construction. When it expires, runtime entries are discarded
and the collector emits `failed` with a timeout reason; it still attempts to
read the process memory summary. Cancellation is cooperative, so an in-flight
system call or non-cancelable parsing step can finish after the deadline.

Inspect `tracer_data.snapshot.status` (`complete`, `partial`,
`unavailable`, or `failed`) together with `status_reason`, `runtime_version`,
`duration_ms`, and `output_truncated`.

`status_reason` explains why collection is `partial`, `unavailable`, or `failed`;
it is omitted when empty. Both `snapshot` and `process_memory` use this field.
Older records may use `reason`; readers of historical and new records should
accept both names.

`duration_ms` measures the provider stage, rounded up to milliseconds, for both
successful and failed snapshots, including timeouts. It excludes runtime
detection, process memory summary reads, output processing, and persistence.

| Problem | Checks |
|---------|--------|
| No output | Enable and restart; check BlackList; see section 7.6 for v2 trigger conditions |
| Event without a candidate | Check direct cgroup membership, OOM-kill eligibility, and enumeration limits |
| `unavailable` / `failed` | Check runtime/layout restrictions, access permissions, container metadata, and target exit; inspect `status_reason` |
| Event stops after resource exhaustion | Check `RLIMIT_NOFILE`, `fs.inotify.max_user_watches`, and `fs.inotify.max_user_instances`; adjust and restart; this stop does not stop other events |
